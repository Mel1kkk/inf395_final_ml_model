# INF395 Final Project: Metacritic Review Rating Prediction

This project is part of the INF395 course, where we explored machine learning models to predict Metacritic review scores based on game metadata. We used Python, `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping, and `Gradio` for building a simple interactive interface that visualizes predictions vs actual scores.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Data Collection**: Scraped game review data from Metacritic using `BeautifulSoup`.
- **Modeling**: Trained several machine learning models (like Linear Regression, Random Forest and so on) to predict Metacritic scores.
- **UI**: Built a Gradio web app to:
  - **Select game metadata** from the dataset.
  - Predict its Metacritic rating.
  - Show real rating vs predicted rating for comparison.

## 📊 Features

- Scraping & cleaning data from Metacritic.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Multiple ML model training and evaluation.
- Gradio-based interface for prediction and visualization.
